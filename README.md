## What is Dumper?

Dumper is a simple script that grabs all scripts and remotes in a game and writes them to your workspace for you too read and use.
Scripts will not decompile if you do not have a decompiler. If your executor’s decompiler is poor, it may cause significant lag in larger games. If you find a fix to this issue, please DM me.

If you want something added, fixed, or anything else, feel free to DM me.
