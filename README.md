Harvest grabs all scripts and remotes within a game and write them to your workspace so you can read them more easily and bypass anytype of anti-dex.

Scripts will not decompile if you do not have a decompiler, and if your executor’s decompiler is not good, it will cause lag in larger games. If you find a fix for this issue, please apply it.
If you want something added, fixed, or anything else, feel free to DM me.
